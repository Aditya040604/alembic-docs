```
def run_migrations_online() -> None:
    """Run migrations in 'online' mode."""
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(run_async_migrations())
```

Haha, don’t worry, Adi — I’m all charged up for this! ⚡ Let’s deep dive into your `run_migrations_online()` function and what it’s doing.

---

# 1️⃣ The function

```python
def run_migrations_online() -> None:
    """Run migrations in 'online' mode."""
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(run_async_migrations())
```

- Purpose: **kick off online migrations** — the database schema is updated **live**.
    
- Works with **async engines** even though the rest of Alembic was written synchronously.
    

---

# 2️⃣ Step by step

### Step 1: `import asyncio`

- Python’s standard **asynchronous I/O library**.
    
- Needed because we are going to run an **async function** (`run_async_migrations`) from a **regular synchronous context**.
    

### Step 2: `asyncio.run(run_async_migrations())`

- `asyncio.run()` is used to **run an async function from sync code**.
    
- Steps internally:
    
    1. Creates a new **async event loop**.
        
    2. Runs `run_async_migrations()` until it completes.
        
    3. Closes the event loop.
        
- So even though `run_migrations_online()` is **a normal sync function**, it can **execute async migrations** safely.

# 3️⃣ Flow of execution

```
run_migrations_online()
       │
       ▼
asyncio.run(run_async_migrations())
       │
       ▼
run_async_migrations()
       │
       ▼
async_engine_from_config() → async engine
       │
       ▼
async with connectable.connect() as connection
       │
       ▼
await connection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)
       │
       ▼
do_run_migrations(connection)
       │
       ▼
context.run_migrations() → executes SQL in DB
```

- **Outcome:** database schema is updated live (online mode)
    
- Everything happens asynchronously under the hood, but your entry point can remain synchronous.
    

---

# 4️⃣ Why wrap it like this?

- Alembic’s main entry points (`alembic upgrade head`) expect **sync functions**.
    
- Using `asyncio.run()` allows you to **run async migrations** without rewriting Alembic’s CLI.
    
- Clean separation:
    
    - `do_run_migrations()` → sync migration logic
        
    - `run_async_migrations()` → async engine & connection management
        
    - `run_migrations_online()` → sync entry point for Alembic CLI
        

---

# 5️⃣ Analogy

- Offline mode = writing a recipe on paper.
    
- Online sync = cooking synchronously in the kitchen.
    
- Online async = cooking in a kitchen with a **robot assistant** (async engine), but you can still give instructions in a normal way (sync Alembic CLI).
    

---

# ✅ TL;DR

- `run_migrations_online()` = **sync wrapper**
    
- `asyncio.run()` → runs the **async migration function**
    
- Database is updated live.
    
- Works with async engines without changing Alembic’s existing sync logic.
    

---

If you want, I can make a **full visual diagram showing offline, online-sync, online-async, with connections and flows**, so it’s crystal clear how Alembic orchestrates everything.

Do you want me to do that?

Absolutely, Adi! Let’s **go step by step with a concrete example** so this becomes crystal clear. I’ll show **offline vs online vs async-online**, and then specifically how `run_migrations_online()` fits in.

---

# 1️⃣ Scenario

Suppose you have a simple table:

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

You want Alembic to **create this table** in your PostgreSQL database.

---

# 2️⃣ Offline mode

```python
def run_migrations_offline():
    url = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/mydb"
    context.configure(url=url, target_metadata=Base.metadata, literal_binds=True)
    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()
```

- Alembic **does not connect to DB**.
    
- Generates SQL like:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```

- **DB is NOT changed**.
    
- Useful for reviewing SQL before executing.
    

---

# 3️⃣ Online sync mode

```python
def do_run_migrations(connection):
    context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=Base.metadata)
    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()
```

- Requires a **live DB connection**:
    

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb")
with engine.connect() as connection:
    do_run_migrations(connection)
```

- Alembic executes SQL **directly in the DB**:
    
    - `CREATE TABLE users` runs immediately.
        
- **Online = live changes**.
    
- This is all synchronous.
    

---

# 4️⃣ Online async mode

Suppose your project uses **async SQLAlchemy** (common with FastAPI):

```python
async def run_async_migrations():
    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import async_engine_from_config, AsyncEngine
    connectable = async_engine_from_config(
        {"sqlalchemy.url": "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/mydb"},
        prefix="sqlalchemy.",
        poolclass=None
    )
    async with connectable.connect() as connection:
        await connection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)
    await connectable.dispose()
```

- **`async_engine_from_config()`** → creates an **async engine**.
    
- **`connectable.connect()`** → opens an **async connection**.
    
- **`run_sync(do_run_migrations)`** → runs **the same sync migration function** inside the async context.
    

✅ Why run a sync function?

- Alembic migration code is **written synchronously**.
    
- `run_sync()` allows it to run safely on an async connection without rewriting everything as async.
    

---

# 5️⃣ `run_migrations_online()` wraps it

```python
def run_migrations_online():
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(run_async_migrations())
```

- Alembic CLI calls this **sync function**.
    
- `asyncio.run()` creates a **temporary event loop**, runs `run_async_migrations()` (async), and closes the loop.
    
- Net result: **live DB is updated asynchronously**, but the CLI doesn’t have to be async-aware.
    

---

# 6️⃣ Step-by-step flow (example)

Let’s visualize it with your `User` table:

```
run_migrations_online()
       │
       ▼
asyncio.run(run_async_migrations())
       │
       ▼
async_engine_from_config() → AsyncEngine created
       │
       ▼
async with connectable.connect() → AsyncConnection
       │
       ▼
run_sync(do_run_migrations)
       │
       ▼
context.configure(connection)
       │
       ▼
context.run_migrations()
       │
       ▼
SQL executed: CREATE TABLE users
```

- **Offline:** prints SQL only
    
- **Online sync:** executes SQL immediately using sync engine
    
- **Online async:** executes SQL immediately using async engine, sync migration function wrapped with `run_sync()`
    

---

# 7️⃣ Simple analogy

|Mode|Analogy|
|---|---|
|Offline|Writing a recipe (SQL) but not cooking (DB unchanged)|
|Online sync|Cooking immediately using a normal stove (sync engine)|
|Online async|Cooking immediately using a smart stove controlled remotely (async engine), but chef still uses normal instructions (sync function)|

---

✅ **Key points to remember**

1. `run_migrations_online()` = **sync wrapper** around async migrations.
    
2. Async engine + `run_sync()` → allows **existing synchronous migration logic** to run on an async database connection.
    
3. Database is **updated live**.
    
4. Offline mode is **only for SQL generation**, no DB changes.
    

---

If you want, I can make a **side-by-side diagram of offline → online sync → online async** showing **SQL flow, engine, connection, and execution**, which will make this crystal clear.

Do you want me to do that?
