Exactly, Adi â€” this is an important distinction, and people often get confused. Letâ€™s clarify fully.

# ðŸ§± Offline vs Online Migrations

When Alembic talks about **offline** and **online** mode, itâ€™s really about **how migrations are applied**:

|Mode|What Alembic Does|Effect on Database|
|---|---|---|
|**Offline**|Generates raw SQL statements for your migration scripts.|**Does NOT touch the database**. You get a `.sql` file or printed SQL commands. You can review or run them manually.|
|**Online**|Connects to the database and executes migration commands directly via SQLAlchemy.|**Changes are applied immediately** (tables, columns, constraints, etc.)|

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Generating SQL Only (Offline Mode)

When you run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head --sql
```

- Alembic **does not connect to the database**.
    
- It generates SQL statements like:
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE NOT NULL;
```

- You can **copy this SQL and run it manually** in your database, or save it for auditing.
    
- **The database remains unchanged** until you run these SQL statements manually.
    

**Use case:**

- For DBAs who want to review migrations before applying them.
    
- When you cannot directly connect to the DB from your local machine.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Executing Migrations via DB (Online Mode)

When you run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

- Alembic **connects to the database** using the URL in your settings.
    
- It executes all SQL commands **directly**, creating or altering tables, adding columns, etc.
    
- Changes happen immediately in the database.
    

**Behind the scenes:**

1. `env.py` sets up the connection (`async_engine_from_config`)
    
2. `do_run_migrations` runs each migration scriptâ€™s `upgrade()` function
    
3. Alembic uses SQLAlchemy to generate the proper SQL for your DB dialect (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
    
4. The database schema is updated.

## ðŸ”¹ Quick Analogy

Think of it like **cooking instructions**:

- **Offline mode** â†’ you just **print the recipe** (SQL)
    
- **Online mode** â†’ you **cook the meal** (execute SQL in DB)
    

If you only print the recipe, the dish doesnâ€™t exist yet.

## ðŸ”¹ Important Note for Async/Sync

Even with **async engines** (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0), this distinction remains:

- Offline â†’ still just prints SQL
    
- Online â†’ connects via async engine and applies the migrations
    

---

âœ… **TL;DR:**

- **Generating SQL only = preview/print SQL, database is NOT modified.**
    
- **Executing migrations via DB = Alembic actually changes your database schema.**

If you want, I can make a **tiny visual diagram showing offline vs online Alembic migration flow** with exactly what happens to the database. It makes this super clear.

Do you want me to do that?
