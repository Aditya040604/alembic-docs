```
def do_run_migrations(connection: Connection) -> None:
    """Run migrations with the given connection."""
    context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata)

    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()

is this online based? Once again explain deeply and cleary with simple words
```

Absolutely, Adi — let’s **deep dive into `do_run_migrations()`** and understand exactly what it does, how it differs from offline mode, and why it’s considered “online”. I’ll make it simple and visual.

# 1️⃣ The function

```python
def do_run_migrations(connection: Connection) -> None:
    """Run migrations with the given connection."""
    context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata)

    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()
```

---

# 2️⃣ Online vs Offline

- **Offline mode**:
    
    - No database connection is made.
        
    - Alembic **generates SQL scripts only**.
        
    - Useful for review or environments where DB access is restricted.
        
- **Online mode** (this function is part of it):
    
    - Alembic **connects to the database** using the provided `connection`.
        
    - SQL commands **are executed immediately** on the DB.
        
    - Database schema actually changes.
        

✅ So yes, `do_run_migrations()` is **online-based**.

# 3️⃣ Step-by-step explanation

### Step 1: Configure the migration context

```python
context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata)
```

- `connection` = an **active SQLAlchemy DB connection** (created earlier with an engine).
    
- `target_metadata` = your `Base.metadata` (all your table/column definitions).
    
- This tells Alembic:
    
    1. **Where to execute migrations** (the DB connection).
        
    2. **What the schema should look like** (from your models).
        
- Unlike offline mode, here **Alembic does not need a URL** — it already has a live connection.
    

---

### Step 2: Begin a transaction

```python
with context.begin_transaction():
    context.run_migrations()
```

- `context.begin_transaction()` → opens a **real DB transaction**.
    
- `context.run_migrations()` → executes **all migration scripts**:
    

```text
CREATE TABLE users (...);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN;
```

- **Changes happen immediately** in the connected database.
    
- If an error occurs, the transaction can **roll back**, keeping the database consistent.

# 4️⃣ Visual analogy

```
Engine → creates → Connection → passed to do_run_migrations()
                       │
                       ▼
              context.configure(connection)
                       │
              context.begin_transaction()
                       │
              context.run_migrations()
                       │
      SQL executed directly in the database
```

# 5️⃣ Key points

|Aspect|Offline Mode|Online Mode (do_run_migrations)|
|---|---|---|
|DB Connection|❌ No|✅ Yes, live connection|
|SQL Execution|❌ Only generates SQL|✅ Executes SQL immediately|
|Use Case|Review SQL / restricted access|Apply migrations to DB|
|Context configuration|`url=url`|`connection=connection`|
|Transaction|simulated|real DB transaction|

---

# 6️⃣ Important notes

- The `connection` object **already knows the database URL**, because it comes from an **engine** (async or sync).
    
- Alembic uses this connection to **run migrations safely inside a transaction**.
    
- If you have **multiple databases**, you can pass **different connections** to migrate each one.
    

---

### TL;DR (Simple Version)

- `do_run_migrations()` = **online migration runner**.
    
- Takes a **live DB connection** → applies all migrations immediately → database is updated.
    
- Difference from offline: **offline = SQL only, online = DB updated**.

If you want, I can make a **side-by-side diagram of offline vs online migrations showing exactly what Alembic does with SQL, connection, and transactions** — it’s super intuitive visually.
