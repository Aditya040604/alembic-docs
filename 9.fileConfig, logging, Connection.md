Absolutely, Adi — let’s go **really deep** into these two concepts so there’s no confusion.

# 1️⃣ `fileConfig` and Logging

```python
from logging.config import fileConfig
fileConfig(config.config_file_name)
```

---

## 🔹 What “logging” means

- Logging = **systematic messages about what a program is doing**, useful for debugging and monitoring.
    
- Python’s `logging` module allows you to output messages like:
    

```text
INFO [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 12345_create_users_table
WARN [sqlalchemy.engine] Table already exists
ERROR [alembic.runtime.migration] Migration failed
```

These messages appear in **console, files, or other destinations**, depending on configuration.

---

## 🔹 How `fileConfig` works

- `fileConfig` reads your **Alembic `.ini` logging sections**:
    

```ini
[loggers]
keys = root,sqlalchemy,alembic

[handlers]
keys = console

[formatters]
keys = generic

[logger_alembic]
level = INFO
handlers =
qualname = alembic

[handler_console]
class = StreamHandler
args = (sys.stderr,)
formatter = generic
```

- Sets up **loggers, handlers, formatters** automatically.
    
- After this, any calls to:
    

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("alembic").info("Migration started")
```

- Will **print nicely formatted messages** to console or file according to the `.ini`.
    

✅ In short: `fileConfig` just **sets up logging rules** from `.ini`. Without it, you wouldn’t see those Alembic info messages nicely.

# 2️⃣ `Connection` represents a DB connection

```python
from sqlalchemy.engine import Connection
```

---

## 🔹 What a Connection is

- **Connection = a “pipe” from your program to the database**, through which SQL commands are sent and results are received.
    
- Example analogy:
    
    - DB = water tank
        
    - Connection = a pipe to access water
        
    - SQL queries = water flowing through pipe
        

---

## 🔹 How it knows the URL

- The **Connection itself doesn’t know the URL directly** — the URL is used **when creating an engine**:
    

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine

engine = create_async_engine("postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/mydb")
async with engine.connect() as connection:
    # connection now talks to DB
```

- So:
    

1. **Engine** = factory for connections, knows the DB URL
    
2. **Connection** = object you get from engine, actually executes queries
    

In Alembic’s `env.py`:

```python
def do_run_migrations(connection: Connection):
    context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata)
```

- Alembic uses this connection to run migration commands.
    
- The connection **already has the DB URL applied** from the engine.
    

---

## 🔹 Visual Flow

```
Database URL (settings.DATABASE_SYNC_URL)
       │
       ▼
  Async Engine (async_engine_from_config)
       │
       ▼
Connection object (Connection)
       │
       ▼
context.run_migrations()  --> sends SQL to DB
```

- Connection = **the actual live link** to DB for executing commands.
    
- Engine = factory that creates connections using DB URL & pool settings.
    

---

## 🔹 Key Point

- `fileConfig` → sets up **logging** (what messages Alembic prints).
    
- `Connection` → is your **active link to the database**, created from the engine that knows the URL.
    
- You never pass the URL to `Connection` directly; it’s already embedded via the engine.

If you want, I can draw a **diagram showing Alembic env.py, Engine, Connection, URL, and logging** together — it really makes the flow click.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
