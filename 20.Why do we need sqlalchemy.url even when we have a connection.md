Ah, Adi — these are **excellent and subtle questions**! Let’s unpack them **carefully**, step by step, because this is where Alembic’s design and async SQLAlchemy behavior can be confusing.

---

# 1️⃣ Why do we need `sqlalchemy.url` even when we have a connection?

- **Offline mode**:
    
    - Alembic **never creates a connection**.
        
    - It only has the URL so it knows **which dialect (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)** to use when generating SQL.
        
    - Example:
        

```python
url = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/mydb"
```

- Alembic uses this URL to figure out **how to render SQL** (e.g., `SERIAL` vs `AUTO_INCREMENT`, or `:param` vs `?`).
    
- **Online mode with async engine** (`run_async_migrations`):
    
    - The URL is passed to `async_engine_from_config()` to **create an async engine**.
        
    - The engine then produces **live connections**.
        
    - The URL is necessary **to tell SQLAlchemy which database and driver to connect to**.
        

✅ Without the URL, SQLAlchemy **wouldn’t know how to connect** to the DB.

# 2️⃣ Why an async function is running a synchronous function

```python
await connection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)
```

- `do_run_migrations()` is **synchronous** — it uses `context.run_migrations()` which is **not async-aware**.
    
- `run_sync()` is a **helper provided by SQLAlchemy async engine**:
    
    - It takes a sync function
        
    - Runs it **inside the async engine’s context**
        
    - Ensures the connection is properly managed asynchronously
        
- This avoids rewriting **all Alembic migration code** to be async.
    
- Think of it as:
    

```text
Async event loop says: "Hey, I'll run this synchronous function without blocking the loop"
```

- The migrations still **execute SQL in the DB**, just wrapped safely in async context.
    

---

# 3️⃣ Why does `do_run_migrations` need `connection` even though it’s not passed as an argument in `run_async_migrations`?

- Actually, **it is passed** — but indirectly via `run_sync()`:
    

```python
await connection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)
```

- How it works internally:
    

```text
run_sync(sync_func, *args, **kwargs)
```

- `run_sync()` calls:
    

```python
sync_func(connection, *args, **kwargs)
```

- So `do_run_migrations(connection)` receives the live connection **automatically**.
    
- That’s why `do_run_migrations` expects a `Connection` argument — because Alembic needs a live connection to execute migrations.
    

---

# 4️⃣ Putting it together

```
URL -> async_engine_from_config() -> AsyncEngine
AsyncEngine.connect() -> AsyncConnection
AsyncConnection.run_sync(do_run_migrations)
    └─ do_run_migrations(connection)
        └─ context.configure(connection=connection)
        └─ context.run_migrations()  # executes SQL on this connection
```

- **URL** = needed to create engine (engine knows driver, DB, host, credentials)
    
- **Connection** = live connection to execute SQL
    
- **run_sync** = allows sync migration logic to work in async environment
    

---

# ✅ TL;DR in plain words

1. **URL is needed** to create the engine; without it SQLAlchemy wouldn’t know how to connect.
    
2. **Async function wraps sync Alembic migration** using `run_sync()` so we don’t need to rewrite migrations in async.
    
3. `do_run_migrations` gets the live connection **passed by `run_sync()`**, so it can execute migrations online.

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram showing URL → async engine → connection → do_run_migrations → DB**, so you can **see the flow visually**. It’s very helpful to internalize this.

Do you want me to do that?
