If `config.config_file_name` is **`None`**, it means Alembic **was not initialized with a `.ini` file** or the path to the config file wasn’t provided.

Here’s what happens:

---

# 1️⃣ In your code

```python
if config.config_file_name is not None:
    fileConfig(config.config_file_name)
```

- The `if` check **prevents `fileConfig()` from being called**.
    
- Why? Because `fileConfig(None)` would **raise an error**, since Python’s logging module expects a valid file path.
    

So, if it’s `None` → **logging from `.ini` is skipped**.

---

# 2️⃣ What this means in practice

- Alembic **will still run migrations**, but **you won’t get the nicely formatted log messages** from the `.ini` file.
    
- Any logging calls in Alembic will use **Python’s default logging behavior**, which is minimal (usually prints to console with very basic formatting).
    

---

# 3️⃣ Why might it be `None`?

1. You didn’t use `alembic init` → no `.ini` file exists.
    
2. You manually created a `Config()` object in Python without specifying a filename:
    

```python
from alembic.config import Config
config = Config()  # no file given
```

- In that case `config.config_file_name` is `None`.
    

---

# 4️⃣ Key takeaway

- **`None` → skip fileConfig** → Alembic still works, but logging is basic.
    
- If you want full logging, make sure Alembic is initialized with a `.ini` file, or provide a valid config file path when creating the `Config` object.

If you want, I can explain **exactly what would happen to the logging output in Alembic if `config_file_name` is `None`** vs if it’s a valid file — with an example.

Do you want me to do that?
